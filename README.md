# Glow-Image-Denoising-Script
# Image Denoising with Glow Model

## Introduction

This project focuses on image denoising using the Glow model, a powerful generative model. The Glow model, implemented in PyTorch, is employed to remove noise from images, resulting in cleaner and visually appealing reconstructions. The denoising script provided in this repository offers a flexible and customizable solution for users interested in exploring the capabilities of Glow in the context of image processing.

## Description

### Workflow Overview

The denoising script follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Loading:** Utilizes the torchvision library to load image datasets for denoising.
2. **Glow Model Configuration:** Loads a pre-trained Glow model and sets up the necessary configurations.
3. **Noise Generation:** Introduces noise to the input images using Gaussian or Laplacian noise types.
4. **Optimization Loop:** Applies an optimization algorithm to adjust the Glow model parameters for image reconstruction.
5. **Performance Evaluation:** Measures denoising performance using metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio).
6. **Result Saving:** Optionally saves denoised images and performance metrics for further analysis.
